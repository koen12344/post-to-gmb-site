          Works great, I was a little confused at first. But a quick email and a
          fast response explained the process and away we went. Does exactly
          what it says on the can. Set it, forget it, and Google my business is
          updated as we update our site.

          This plugin has some great functionality. And it’s getting better and
          better. I reached out to the developer and suggested some features. We
          had some great dialogue and I can see this plugin only getting better
          and better.

          This plugin saves you mountains of time, especially if you have more
          the one location in Google My Business. I had a little trouble getting
          it to work correctly but with all the support I got from Koen, I have
          everything working as it’s been designed.
